# Huddle

This is a simple landing page by using styled-component.
To master styled-component, I went through one of styled-component crash course on Youtube and picked up the one of Frontend Mentor(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) challenges. 


## ðŸ’ª Through this exercise, I learned

- basic syntax of styled-component.<br>
- get familiar to code structure when I use styled-component in React.<br>
- extra CSS skill! (layout, flexbox, responsive design) 

## ðŸ¤– Setup
to install dependencies
```
npm install
```
to run the application
```
npm start
```
